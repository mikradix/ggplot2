# Roles and responsibilities

This project has a __project lead__, team of __core developers__, and a large community of __contributors__ and __users__.

## Project lead

The job of the project lead is to set the strategic objectives of the project and communicate these clearly to the community, ensuring that the project survives in the long term. The core developers and community actively contribute to the day-to-day maintenance of the project; the project lead sets general strategic direction and approves API changes. In case of disagreement, the project lead has the last word.

The project lead of ggplot2 is [Hadley Wickham](http://github.com/hadley).

## Core developers

Core developers are GitHub administrators and [package authors](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/blob/master/DESCRIPTION#L8). This means that they have the ability of make changes to project code, and receive credit when others cite the package.

While core developers do have the ability to modify source directly, this ability is rarely used. Instead, proposed changes are submitted as pull requests, and are only merged after they have been reviewed by at least one other core developer. Changes to the API (especially breaking changes) must also be approved by the project lead. Core developers are also empowered to review and merge pull requests from contributors. 

Core developers are recruited from contributors. An invitation to join the core team will be extended to anyone who has made a major contribution, either through a small number of large changes, or a consistent pattern of smaller contributions. Any existing core developer can propose a contributor for be invited to the core team, pending confirmation by existing authors.

The core developers of ggplot2 are:

* [Winston Chang](https://github.com/wch)
* [Lionel Henry](https://github.com/lionel- )
* [Thomas Lin Pedersen](https://github.com/thomasp85)
* [Kohske Takahashi](https://github.com/kohske)
* [Claus Wilke](https://github.com/clauswilke)
* [Kara Woo](https://github.com/karawoo)

## Contributors

Contributors are community members who interact with the project on GitHub either by filing new issues, improving existing issues, or submitting pull requests. Anyone can become a contributor. There is no expectation of commitment to the project, no specific skill requirements and no selection process. To become a contributor, a community member simply has to perform one or more actions described above.

Specific advice for contributing to the project is provided in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Users

Users are community members who use the package, without interacting with GitHub. They are the most important members of the community: without them, the project would have no purpose. 

Users are encouraged to participate in the life of the project and the community as much as possible. User contributions enable the project team to ensure that they are satisfying the needs of those users. Common user activities include (but are not limited to):

- evangelising about the project
- asking and answering on community forums
- providing moral support (a 'thank you' goes a long way)

Users who continue to engage with the project and its community will often find themselves becoming more and more involved. Such users may then go on to become contributors, as described above.

# Decision-making process

This project makes decisions according to a consensus model where suggestions are considered and discussed between the community and core developers. In case of conflict, the project leadâ€™s word is final. If the community chooses to question the wisdom of the actions of a core developer, the project lead can review their decision, and either uphold or reverse them.
